# Using the trained AC power-flow surrogates

Three PF surrogates were trained on the Phase-0 backbone corpus, one model per
grid. This is how to take one of them — SimBench is the worked example — and run
it on your own machine.

Companion to `GRIDFM_GRIDSFM_WINDOWS_GPU_RUN.md`, which covers the older
GridFM / GridSFM / LUMINA OPF work. This document is only about power flow.

## 0. Status, before you rely on anything here

| Variant | Training | SimBench checkpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `mirror` | **31/31 complete** | final |
| `graphkit` | **31/31 complete** | final |
| `mirrorpin` | **1/31 complete — still running** | **provisional, epoch 29 of 40** |

The `mirrorpin` checkpoint shipped here is a mid-training snapshot. Its filename
says so:

```
pf_mirrorpin_SimBench_b64_best_PROVISIONAL_epoch29of40.pt
```

It will load and it will produce sensible numbers, but **those numbers will
change** when the run finishes, so do not quote them. It is included only so the
loading path can be exercised end to end. The final version will replace it
under the plain name `pf_mirrorpin_SimBench_b64_best.pt`.

## 1. What the three variants are

All three predict the same thing — the bus voltage state \|V\|, θ given the
injections — and all three are **trained from scratch**. `gridfm_graphkit` ships
no weights, so none of these is "pretrained" and none should be described that
way.

| Variant | Model | \|V\| at PV/slack, θ at slack |
|---|---|---|
| `mirror` | `GridFMHeteroSurrogate` (ours, GridFM-style) | **predicted** |
| `mirrorpin` | the same model, `--pin_known` | **held to the given input** |
| `graphkit` | IBM `gridfm_graphkit` `GNS_heterogeneous` | held to the given input |

### Why `mirrorpin` exists

In AC power flow \|V\| is an *input* at PV and slack buses, and the angle is an
input at the slack; only the rest is unknown. `mirror` ignores this and predicts
a correction at every bus, so it can — and does — walk away from values it was
handed. Measured on case118, where 46% of buses have \|V\| given:

```
mean |V| moved away from the given value : 2.253e-03 pu
mean |V| error against the solver        : 2.253e-03 pu   <- identical
max                                      : 1.648e-02 pu
angle error at the slack bus             : 0.150 deg
```

The first two lines agreeing to every digit is the whole point: at those buses
the given value *is* the answer, so whatever the model moves is exactly what it
gets wrong. `mirrorpin` fixes it; a verification run confirms the shift becomes
exactly `0.000e+00` at PV/slack while PQ buses keep their full freedom.

**`mirror` is kept only for reproducibility of the first campaign.** For new
work use `mirrorpin` or `graphkit`.

### A consequence for comparisons

`graphkit` and `mirrorpin` are exact by construction at the buses they pin, so a
pooled \|V\| error compares them favourably against `mirror` for a reason that
has nothing to do with modelling quality. Compare on PQ buses only —
`pf_predict.py` prints that line separately.

## 2. Get the files

Everything is on the transfer server under `~/PIGNN-Attn-LS/pf_release/`:

```bash
scp -r chkim@131.188.35.62:~/PIGNN-Attn-LS/pf_release .
```

PowerShell is the same command. Contents:

```text

└── scripts/         everything needed to load and run a checkpoint
```

### Which parquet

The filename carries the provenance and it matters:

- `_ppNR_` — solved by **pandapower** Newton-Raphson. This is the Phase-0
  backbone corpus. `LVN_heo1` instead carries `_cNR_` because pandapower cannot
  solve that grid and it was produced with the custom NR oracle.
- Do **not** select files by size or by the `_A_` tag; `_A_` is a different,
  older scenario set. Select on the solver tag.
- `_rg20` means the file was rewritten to 20 rows per parquet row group.
  Training and evaluation shuffle, so a file written with 3000–6000 rows per
  group decodes a whole group to serve one sample — measured at 3191 ms/batch
  against 176 ms/batch, an 18× penalty. SimBench was already at 20 and has no
  suffix.

---

## 3. Environment

Python 3.12, and the loader needs the same numerical setup the models were
trained with:

```bash
pip install torch==2.7.1 torch-geometric==2.8.0 numpy pandas pyarrow scipy
```

For the `graphkit` variant only, additionally:

```bash
pip install --no-deps -e /path/to/gridfm-graphkit
pip install opt_einsum lightning matplotlib torch_scatter
```

`torch_scatter` must match your torch/CUDA build:

```bash
pip install torch_scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.1+cu126.html
```

CPU works; a GPU is only needed for speed. On an H100 the SimBench test split
runs in well under a minute.

---

## 4. Run it

```bash
cd pf_release/scripts
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD

python pf_predict.py \
  --PARQUET ../data/SimBench_ppcY_backbone_dc_compile_ppNR_ls0.60-1.40_u0clean_siNR_36000_NR_branchrows_directSI.parquet \
  --ckpt   ../ckpt/pf_mirror_SimBench_b64_best.pt \
  --variant mirror
```

Output:

```text
[model] mirror  params=20,049,458  device=cuda
[error] |V|  MAE 8.3092e-04  RMSE 1.0483e-03 pu
[error] theta MAE 2.1671e-02  RMSE 3.3881e-02 deg
[error] |V| at PQ only: MAE 8.5579e-04  RMSE 1.0653e-03 pu
```

The other two, same parquet:

```bash
python pf_predict.py --PARQUET ../data/SimBench_...parquet \
  --ckpt ../ckpt/pf_graphkit_SimBench_b64_best.pt --variant graphkit

python pf_predict.py --PARQUET ../data/SimBench_...parquet \
  --ckpt ../ckpt/pf_mirrorpin_SimBench_b64_best_PROVISIONAL_epoch29of40.pt --variant mirrorpin
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--n 2000` | cap the number of scenarios; leave off for the whole test split |
| `--split all` | score every scenario instead of the held-out third |
| `--save_npz out.npz` | write predictions and references for your own analysis |
| `--device cpu` | force CPU |
| `--BATCH 32` | batch size; see §7 on memory |

### `--variant` has to be right

It is not stored in the checkpoint. `graphkit` and `mirror` have different
parameter names, so a mismatch fails loudly at `load_state_dict`. But `mirror`
and `mirrorpin` **share identical weights** and differ only in whether known
quantities are pinned — a mismatch there loads cleanly and silently changes what
is predicted. Match the variant to the filename.

---

## 5. Reference numbers, SimBench

From the finished runs, held-out test split:

| Variant | RMSE | \|V\| RMSE | θ RMSE | slope \|V\| | R² \|V\| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mirror` | 1.203e-03 | 1.048e-03 | 0.034° | 0.998 | 0.9986 |
| `graphkit` | 3.885e-03 | 1.585e-03 | 0.203° | 0.992 | 0.9922 |
| `mirrorpin` | *pending* | — | — | — | — |

If your run reproduces the \|V\| RMSE above, your environment is right.

**On `slope` and `R²`:** these come from a pooled regression of predicted
against reference values, and they answer a question MAE cannot. \|V\| in pu
only spans about 0.95–1.10, so a flat predictor of `V = 1.0` posts a small MAE
while carrying no information at all. Slope 1 means the model tracks the
reference spread one-for-one; slope well below 1 means it is collapsing toward
the mean. SimBench is healthy at 0.998. Several harder grids in the corpus are
not — six sit below 0.5 — so check the slope before trusting a small MAE.

---

## 6. Other grids

31 grids were trained, 4 to 9241 buses. Checkpoints follow the same naming:

```text
results/ckpt/<group>/pf_<variant>_<grid>_b<batch>_best.pt
```

with these groups on helma:

| Variant | Group |
|---|---|
| `mirror` | `pf_gridfm_h100_20260810_221252` |
| `graphkit` | `pf_gridfm_h100_20260811_135024` |
| `mirrorpin` | `pf_gridfm_h100_20260812_120439` |

The batch in the filename is what that grid was trained with, and it varies with
grid size (64 down to 12) — see §7. Ask for a specific grid to be packaged, or
copy it yourself from
`/home/hpc/b313dc/b313dc11/PIGNN-Attn-LS/PIGNN-Attn-LS-PPC/results/ckpt/`.

Two grids need a caveat before their numbers are used:

- **case145** has 7885 scenarios where every other grid has ~36000 — 22% of the
  data. It is the worst grid on every metric, and a ±20% regeneration is
  outstanding. Do not compare it against the others.
- Scenario counts are not uniform elsewhere either: case9241pegase 18280,
  case6515rte 20135, case6495rte 23332, case6470rte 25551, case300 27994.

---

## 7. Memory, if you retrain

Two things bound the batch size, and only one of them is the GPU.

**The Y-bus used to be the wall.** The collate built a *dense* block-diagonal
Y-bus, costing `(B·N)² × 16` bytes — quadratic in batch times buses. case2848rte
at batch 32 asked for 124 GB and every large grid was OOM-killed. It is now
assembled as sparse COO: on case2848rte at batch 8 that is **7921 MB → 1.8 MB**,
verified numerically identical (the implied injection agrees to 1.1e-11
absolute, i.e. complex128 rounding).

**What binds now is activation memory**, measured directly on case9241pegase:

| batch | B·N | peak GPU |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 9,241 | 4.3 GB |
| 8 | 73,928 | 33.6 GB |
| 16 | 147,856 | 67.0 GB |
| 24 | 221,784 | OOM (93.3 GB usable) |

Linear at ~479 KB per node for this model shape (hidden 48, 12 layers, 8 heads).
The dispatcher picks the batch from a `B·N ≤ 120000` budget, which is ~54 GB.
Re-measure if you change the model shape — the constant belongs to the
architecture, not the data.

Do not extrapolate from the point where a job *failed*: the memory reported at
an OOM is the allocator's ceiling, not the model's demand. Estimating that way
gave 166 KB/node against a true 479 KB/node and cost two failed campaigns.

## 8. Retraining from scratch

```bash
python train_valid_test_gridfm.py \
  --PARQUET grid.parquet --task pf \
  --gridfm_impl mirror \        # or: graphkit
  --pin_known \                 # mirror only; omit for the original behaviour
  --run_name my_run \
  --log_to_file --log_dir results/logs/my_group --ckpt_dir results/ckpt/my_group \
  --PER_UNIT --target_S_base 1e8 --share_grid --lazy_parquet --row_group_cache_size 4 \
  --dataset_complex_dtype complex128 \
  --BATCH 64 --EPOCHS 40 --LR 5e-4 --VAL_EVERY 1 \
  --train_ratio 0.3333 --valid_ratio 0.3333 --seed_value 42 \
  --mse_weight 1.0 --physics_weight 1e-2 --physics_loss_form logcosh \
  --hidden_size 48 --num_layers 12 --n_heads 8 \
  --zero_init_head --vn_feature_mode log --feature_transform signed_log
```

`--task pf` is the default. On a cluster, `dispatch_pf_gridfm.sh` handles grid
selection, batch sizing and staging; `IMPL=graphkit` and `PIN=1` select the
variant, and `SEEDS="42 43 44"` runs multiple seeds per grid.

### Multiple seeds

Single runs are not enough to rank models here. The same configuration gave
1.040e-3 on one cluster and 4.300e-3 on another for case14, and two GridSFM
scratch runs swapped rank between clusters. PFDelta's benchmark trains every
model three times and reports the standard deviation; `SEEDS` implements that,
and `summarize_rescore.py` reports mean ± sd when it finds more than one seed.
**The results in §5 are single-seed and carry no error bar.**

---

## 9. Scripts

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `pf_predict.py` | load a checkpoint and predict — the entry point |
| `train_valid_test_gridfm.py` | training driver, all three variants |
| `Dataset_optimized_complex_columns.py` | parquet loader, per-unit conversion, Y-bus |
| `collate_blockdiag_optimized_complex_columns.py` | batching, sparse block-diagonal Y-bus, `ybus_matvec` |
| `gridfm_graphkit_adapter.py` | `graphkit` only: model construction, edge attributes, masks |
| `known_operator_pf.py` | imported by the training driver |
| `prediction_diagnostics.py` | MAE, median, regression slope/R/R² |
| `rescore_pf.py` | re-score a saved checkpoint without retraining |
| `summarize_rescore.py` | aggregate re-scores, mean ± sd across seeds |
| `rewrite_rowgroups.py` | fix parquet row-group layout (`--scan` to inspect only) |
| `dispatch_pf_gridfm.sh` | cluster dispatcher: grids, batch sizing, staging |
| `dispatch_rescore_pf.sh` | cluster dispatcher for re-scoring |

`pf_predict.py` needs the first six. The rest are for retraining or analysis.

---

## 10. Two conventions that will bite you

**Bus type numbering differs between the two pipelines.** In the parquet
pipeline used here it is **1 = slack, 2 = PV, everything else = PQ** — verified
on case118, which has 1 slack, 53 PV and 64 PQ. The OPFData pipeline elsewhere
in this repo uses MATPOWER numbering (1 = PQ, 2 = PV, 3 = ref). Getting this
backwards produced a PQ-restricted metric that selected the slack bus alone and
reported an error of exactly `0.000e+00`, which looks like a perfect model.

**`--PER_UNIT` means the branch admittances are already converted.** The loader
has applied the local bus bases before the model sees them. Applying them again
— the natural thing to do, since the SI reconstruction path works in SI — is
wrong by `Vbase²/S_base`. An early version of the graphkit edge adapter did
exactly that and missed the Y-bus by a relative 7.5e2. It did not raise; it
trained and produced plausible-looking numbers. `validate_edge_attr_parquet`
exists to catch it and passes at machine precision (rel_err 1.4e-16 … 2.6e-16
across case118, SimBench, LVN_heo1, GBnetwork).
